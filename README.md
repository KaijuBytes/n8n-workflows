# n8n Workflows Repository

Welcome to my personal n8n Workflows repository! Here, I collect and share the automated workflows I've built to streamline my daily tasks and integrate various services using n8n.

## About This Repository

This repo is a curated collection of my own n8n workflows. Each workflow is documented in its own Markdown file, with clear instructions on setup, configuration, and usage. I created these workflows to automate repetitive tasks, improve productivity, and experiment with n8n's powerful automation capabilities.

### Included Workflows

- **Gmail Label Automation**: Automatically labels Gmail messages based on custom rules and criteria.
## How to Use

1. **Clone this Repository**

5. **Activate and Enjoy**  
   Enable the workflow and let n8n handle the automation for you!

## Why I Made This

I built this repository to document and reuse my own automations, and to share ideas with others who want to get more out of n8n. Feel free to explore, adapt, or contribute your own workflows!
